/**
 * Profile composition diagnostics — issue #98 (phase 1): the check-only
 * "plugin loading layer and conflict view".
 *
 * Pure filesystem analysis of one dsh profile directory; no processes, no
 * network, no writes. It answers, for the profile the market is serving:
 *
 *  1. What is the actual bundle stack (dsh.profile.bundles order) and where
 *     does each layer come from (official in-box bundle vs community, the
 *     dependency spec, the resolved directory)?
 *  2. Which loader entry ids does the composed tree contain, and are any
 *     duplicated across layers (the "duplicate loader entry id" boot failure
 *     from #98)? Which rows does a later layer override?
 *  3. Does any installed plugin pull a DSH host core package
 *     (@deepseek-ai/dsh, @deepseek-ai/dsh-tools, @deepseek-ai/cordis, …) in
 *     as an ordinary dependency — the dsh-excel-chat failure mode where the
 *     plugin's copy gets hoisted to the profile root and shadows the host's
 *     version (tool calls die, minimal preset fails to mount)?
 *  4. Are there multiple versions of one core package in the lockfile, and
 *     do plugin peerDependencies ranges match the resolved core version?
 *
 * The composition step mirrors @deepseek-ai/dsh-app-boot's applyEntryPatches
 * (same js-yaml dialect incl. `!!js` scalars), so the rows reported here are
 * what actually mounts at boot.
