/**
 * The operations model behind the market's activity panel: one record per
 * mutating operation (install, update, uninstall), from the moment it is
 * queued until the user clears it.
 *
 * It exists because operation state used to live on the card that started it,
 * which disappears the moment the user paginates, searches, or switches tab —
 * taking any decision attached to it, such as a loader-id clash, along with
 * it. Records live here instead, keyed by their own id, so the card only has
 * to ask "is anything running for this url".
 *
 * Every function is pure so the queue, the aggregate counts, and the
 * three-way visual grouping can be tested without a host or a DOM.
