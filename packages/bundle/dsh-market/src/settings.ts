/**
 * The market's own settings namespace: the half that makes `allowRestart`
 * a switch on the plugin configuration page instead of a line the user has
 * to hand-write into cordis.yml.
 *
 * `allowRestart: false` is the documented answer for a host owned by
 * systemd, launchd or pm2 — a supervisor restarts it, so the market's
 * one-click restart must not launch a second one. Until now the only way to
 * say that was editing YAML in the right place with the right indentation,
 * where a stray space stops the profile booting.
 *
 * Only `allowRestart` is exposed. `profile` names which profile this
 * instance manages: it is decided at mount from the composition or the
 * command line, and a running instance cannot switch to another one, so
 * offering it as a field would promise something the write cannot deliver.
 *
 * The release channel is NOT here either, and that is a correction rather
 * than an omission. It was, briefly, and it made this namespace a second
 * writer for a value the market already stores in its own state.json: the
 * mount read the user's saved channel off disk, then `onChange` assigned
 * `source().channel` — which knows nothing about that file — straight back
 * over it. The choice survived exactly until the next settings event.
 *
 * Only a real host could show that; the unit lane mounts the routes without
 * this layer at all. `allowRestart` needs this door because its only other
 * one is hand-edited YAML. The channel has a control of its own on the
 * plugin configuration page, so a second door bought nothing and cost the
 * setting its memory.
 *
 * installSettingsSection rides the scoped fiber, so a host with no settings
 * service — every dsh before 0.1.0-rc.7 — simply never runs any of this and
 * the entry configuration stands as composed. That is why this needs no
 * version check of its own.
